              Kia Ora, my name is Adam. I am a web developer with a passion
              for creating dynamic and cool websites. I have some experience
              in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly learning new
              technologies to improve my skills.I am of Chinese and Vietnamese descent,
               and my diverse background inspires me to approach web development
                with a unique perspective. Whether it's building intuitive
                 interfaces or crafting interactive features, I'm driven
                 by the challenge of bringing creative ideas to life on the web.

                I am passionate about working out and hitting the gym, which

                I have been adept at math from a young age, which has sharpened
                my analytical and problem-solving abilities. My gaming skills
                are top-notch, demonstrating quick reflexes and strategic
                thinking. Additionally, I have hands-on experience working as a
                cashier in my parents shop, where I've developed strong customer
                service and organizational skills.
